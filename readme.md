# Hypackel Lite

Welcome to Hypackel Lite! I've received several requests to bring Hypackel back online. Since AWS is expensive, I'm switching to GitHub Pages. However, there's a 3GB limit, so I won't be able to include as many games for now. Game requests are currently closed but will reopen later.
